## I. Discipline Background: The AI Impact and the Crisis of Individual Value

The driving force of human civilization is undergoing a fundamental shift. Previous technological revolutions never truly challenged the fundamental premise of "the value of the human individual." However, the maturation of AI has, for the first time, created an **inescapable feedback loop**:

technological progress is unstoppable →
this inevitably leads to the emergence of more comprehensive AI tools → 
the value of the individual (the right to exist with significance) faces systematic erosion →
the need to defend our existence and value becomes urgent → 
which forces our societal goals to converge on a single objective: **Immortality**, the ultimate enhancement of the human scale.

As this loop tightens, it signifies the gradual obsolescence of the old paradigm of development. This is no longer a cyclical pain, but a fundamental change in the very logic of survival. Therefore, "Immortality" is no longer a philosophical fancy or a religious solace, but **the only pragmatic way out** of the current, deepening crisis of individual human value.

### **II. Defining "Immortality"**

"Immortality" is not a static destination to be directly arrived at; it is defined by three interrelated attributes:

1.  **Symbolic Attribute:** "**Immortality" is human civilization's ultimate affirmation and safeguard of individual existence and value**. It embodies the fundamental assertion that an individual human being possesses inherent and supreme (or priceless) value, and it necessitates the actions required to uphold this principle. This ranges from ethical protections to the active enhancement of the individual. Overcoming natural death is its most tangible manifestation, but at a deeper level, it is about defending human agency, ensuring that the individual can never be rendered obsolete or insignificant under any circumstances.

2.  **Technical Attribute:**  **Immortality is not a single technology, but rather an open-ended collection of technologies, sustained by an ecosystem designed for their continuous expansion and refinement**. ​ It has no predefined quantifiable final form. This attribute encompasses not only specific technologies—be it today's gene editing and brain-computer interfaces or those yet to be discovered—but also the essential activities that fuel their progress, such as resource mobilization and awareness campaigns. Any endeavor whose core objective is to push the boundaries of individual cognition, survival, and experience falls within the technical purview of "Immortality." We acknowledge and embrace this inherent openness, which is precisely why global collaboration and perpetual exploration are indispensable.

3.  **Process Attribute:** **Immortality is a dynamic process unfolding on a vast temporal and spatial scale**. It signifies that humanity, as a whole, has embarked on an open-ended project of self-upgrading. This process is non-linear, involving trial and error, branching paths, and convergence. The measure of progress is not whether "Immortality" is achieved at some fixed point, but rather whether we are continually extending healthspan and enhancing cognitive abilities across time, and whether we are pushing the physical limits of our existence across space, all while steadfastly upholding the supreme value of the individual. **This "process" nature allows us, and indeed compels us, to begin the journey now, despite the current incompleteness of the requisite technologies. Furthermore, throughout this entire process, the highest affirmation of individual existence and value must be steadfastly upheld.**

## III. Discipline Definition: Systematically Engineering Immortality

**Immortics** is a comprehensive discipline. It is dedicated to integrating the cross-disciplinary knowledge required for "Immortality" and to sustaining the continuous expansion of its technological ecosystem. Its mission is **to translate civilization's supreme safeguard of individual existence and value from an ideal into a systematic, executable engineering paradigm**.

### Core Disciplinary Framework
| Branch                                                         | Objective                                                                                   | Representative Directions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Individual Engineering**<br>(Technical Implementation Layer) | Address threats to individual existence and value, and explore ultimate technical pathways. | Biological Engineering (programmatic cell regeneration, tissue cultivation); Mechanical Engineering (ambient adaptability enhancement); Information Engineering (brain-computer interfaces, consciousness substrates, cognitive enhancement); Manufacturing Engineering (advancements in the cost, capacity, customization, and precision of cultivation and production processes). |
| **Social Engineering**<br>(System Support Layer)               | Steer civilizational resources toward the goal of individual immortality.                   | Resource allocation (individual logistics support, research resource aggregation); Consensus building (literature, film/television, video game); Legal/Ethical support (safeguarding individual rights, facilitating research progress); Collaborative networks (platforms, communities).                                                                                           |


Within the framework of this discipline, Individual Engineering and Social Engineering will interact directly, reinforce each other, and form an efficient closed loop of **"technological breakthrough → social support → iterative upgrade"**.

**Inheritance and Reconstruction of Traditional Immortology**  
We respect the enlightening and literary value of traditional Immortology in the era of technological scarcity, but its philosophical speculations must be re-engineered:  
- **Assimilation and Transformation**: Theories consistent with the empirical spirit are incorporated into the engineering framework.  
- **Documentation and Preservation**: Purely speculative content is preserved as historical literature.  
- **Repositioning**: Its core value is redirected to the branch of Social Engineering, focusing on disseminating ideas and public enlightenment, thereby building a consensus foundation for technological breakthroughs.  

### Discipline Engineering Task Map
Based on the deep integration of this discipline with engineering attributes, its body of knowledge can be naturally presented from an engineering perspective through a task network, allowing learners to engage without relying on top-down, indoctrination-based theoretical learning. Each node in the task network is presented in the following forms:  
*   **Prerequisites**: The conditions required to initiate a task (e.g., "clinical trials" require "ethical approval").  
*   **Process Dependencies**: The continuous resources required during execution, including hard resources like funds, data, and equipment, as well as soft contributions from various roles such as chefs and writers.  
*   **Subsequent Enablers**: New fields or tasks enabled upon completion (e.g., a breakthrough in "ambient adaptability enhancement" enables "deep space exploration").  

The technological scale involved in "Immortality" is vast, making it difficult to measure using traditional disciplinary divisions. This engineering-task-oriented organizational approach will effectively lower the barrier to entry, ensuring that everyone can contribute based on their own conditions, learn through practice, and genuinely safeguard the discipline's openness and participativity. Furthermore, it encourages starting from any existing real-world starting point and respects bottom-up path innovation. It allows localized outcomes to naturally converge within the task map, collectively coalescing around the goal of "Immortality."

## IV. Guiding Principles for Development

As a discipline emerging later, it will inherit the time-tested knowledge system of the traditional academic regime while wholly discarding all elements that isolate academia from societal production or disadvantage newcomers. These outdated functions will be progressively replaced by the intellectual resources of Artificial Intelligence.

### Pragmatic Knowledge Open-Source Strategy
A tiered strategy is adopted to balance ideals with reality:
*   **Full Open-Source**: Processes and outcomes are immediately and comprehensively open.
*   **Partial Open-Source**: Core interfaces or modules are open for access.
*   **Conditional Open-Source**: Commitment to open sourcing upon meeting specific conditions, for example: reaching specific milestones, recouping costs, or obtaining sufficient commercial return.
*   **Open-Source by Conviction**: We hold the conviction that upon maturity, Immortality technologies should be bound to the right to survival, and we will actively promote legal frameworks to align with this principle.

### Real-Time and Credible Evaluation System
We will abandon the rigid review model reliant on endorsements from 'senior academics'. Instead, we will build an AI-based, real-time evolving 'guidance system':
*   **Initial Phase**: A "human collaboration with AI assistance" model.
*   **Long-Term Goal**: Transition to an AI-core, real-time, dynamic, and impartial evaluation system to ensure research consistently aligns with the ultimate objective.

### Honor System and Collaborative Ethics
-   **Equality of Contributors**: Honor is allocated based on actual contribution, rejecting the current state where "author privilege" prevails or resource contributions are overlooked.
-   **Diversity of Value and Anti-Involution Consensus**: Acknowledge the value of parallel research and learning from trial and error; malignant competition is not recognized, and the value of collaboration supersedes isolated priority.
-   **Inclusion of Controversial Content**: There is no need to enforce a unified global value judgment. Any contributor can, through ongoing advocacy and elaboration, help more people recognize the unique value of their work.
-   **Procedural Justice**: The pursuit of individual immortality must not be achieved by means that undermine the value of others, as this would betray the very essence of immortality from its foundation.

## V. Independent Operational Foundation and Driving Force

The advancement and innovation of this discipline do not rely on the recognition or integration of the traditional academic system. Its operation is based on a **decentralized open-source collaborative ecosystem** supported by blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the global internet.

### Foundational Operational Basis

1.  **Technological Foundation:**
    -   **Blockchain**: Constructs a credible, decentralized system of honor and value by completely recording the R&D (research and development) process metadata. This foundation enables a new academic credit system to gradually replace the traditional "publication-citation" based mechanism.
    -   **Artificial Intelligence**: Serves as a vital research tool and a real-time, dynamic evaluation system, gradually replacing human review processes that are lagging and prone to bias. This foundation is capable of learning and synthesizing knowledge directly from trustworthy R&D processes, thereby gradually replacing formulaic human summarization and publication procedures.
    -   **Global Internet**: Enables seamless connectivity and real-time resource sharing among global collaborators, breaking down traditional barriers of geography and institution.

2.  **Human Foundation:**
    The participants in this discipline naturally form the main body of the **Open-source Immortal Cultivators Alliance**. Researchers, developers, resource supporters, and communicators converge here to form a goal-oriented, functionally complementary, and mutually beneficial collective. This represents a complete break from the traditional academic model, which is often closed and detached from engineering practice.

### Disciplinary Driving Forces

1.  **Endogenous Driving Force: An Ecological Cycle Under Goal Consensus**
    The fundamental driving force of this system is not honor or professional titles, but stems from a shared identification with the ultimate goal of "Immortality." Based on this consensus, a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle emerges within the ecosystem:
    -   **Technological breakthroughs** provide a more solid foundation for Social Engineering, benefiting every individual;
    -   **Social consensus** enables resource pooling, which in turn drives more cutting-edge technological exploration;
    -   **Individual contributions** receive fair evaluation and honorary incentives within the ecosystem, continuously stimulating participation.

2.  **External Pressure: The Demand for Individual Enhancement Driven by Technological Progress**
    Immortics regards the challenge posed by technological progress to individual value as a core external pressure for the discipline's development. The fundamental principle is: **It categorically rejects limiting technological progress to safeguard individual value. Instead, the response is to adapt to, guide, and ultimately steer the outcomes of technological development by enhancing the human individual's own scale, thereby benefiting humanity itself.**

Founded on **collaborative symbiosis and mutual achievement**, the entire ecosystem enables Immortics to break free from traditional academia's internal friction and suppression. This liberation allows for sustained, accelerated advancement toward "Immortality."

## VI. Ultimate Engineering Objectives

### Objectives for Individual Capabilities
1.  **Perfect Wisdom Across Temporal Scales**
    -   The individual can sustainably maintain peak cognitive states, autonomously orchestrating learning, forgetting, and knowledge modification to generate optimal strategies for self-regulation and environmental interaction.
2.  **Near-Indestructibility Across Spatial Scales**
    -   The individual possesses extreme resilience against damage and robust self-reorganizing capabilities, making it exceedingly difficult to be physically erased.
3.  **Constant Stability Throughout Processes**
    -   The individual can invariably overcome internal issues independently, maintaining stable progression without requiring external coercive intervention.

### Objectives for Societal Relations
-   Rigid interdependencies and hierarchical structures between individuals are replaced by flexible, collaborative networks.
-   A civilizational consensus emerges, embracing "collaboration over harm" as the fundamental pathway to achievement.

> **Key Insight**: Due to the symbolic, technical, and processual nature of Immortality, any "immortality" achieved through means of controlling, plundering, or eliminating others inherently contains the seed of its own destruction within its final form. This is, in essence, an unstable form of "pseudo-immortality." As the discipline evolves, it will progressively purify itself of such means; societal relations will evolve towards pure collaboration as individual capability anxd independence increase.
